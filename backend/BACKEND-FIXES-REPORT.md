## 🚀 Testing Instructions

### 1. Run Health Check

```powershell
./backend/test-backend-health.ps1
```

### 2. Test Swagger Documentation

- Product Service: http://localhost:5001/swagger
- Order Service: http://localhost:5002/swagger
- Inventory Service: http://localhost:5003/swagger

### 3. Test CRUD Operations

```bash
# Create Product
curl -X POST "http://localhost:5001/api/v1/products" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Test Toy",
    "description": "A test toy for validation",
    "price": 29.99,
    "stockQuantity": 100,
